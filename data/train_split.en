He wants to go to trial. We're going this afternoon.

His hand was like a knife her leg was like a drill

But your cancer couldn't have come at a better time.

He just sits there during class staring at the window, and I ask him,

But until you get on track I don't want you down there.

And I'm proud of you for trying to be interested.

I'm feeling kind of nervous about this routine, I have to use the East coast style.

But you are a girl - loving, full - on lesbian!

No, no, no. Actually, I don't think those pants are too dressy at all,

Ah - ha, but you learned it. You could teach us.

You try to do this without me! - how are you seeing us right now?

Well, this upright chap certainly enjoyed patronizing some dodgy women.

Didn't I tell you not to call in the morning

Okay, but when do you get to the point where you stop expecting somebody to change?

To an important event? Are you out of your mind?
