Uh, I am pretty drunk, but I didn't call you for a ride home. 
When do I get to French kiss a girl? Come on. Come on. 
Once you've been through something like that with a person... 
Hey, it's me. I'm just wondering if you looked into that clinic yet. 
Such an important situation -  This shot is difficult for any player

Our office is willing to take the death penalty off the table 
You know she's a Muslim, which means she's a virgin. 
Who sits home and watches cartoons all day. Why can she have a baby and I can't? 
And if you pick the right one out of these three cards, 
Do you think he's in there? - we'll find out. 
Yep, a red one, and I'm never gonna stop flying. I'm thirsty. I'm gonna get some water. 
It is enlarged and it's putting some pressure on your bladder. 
And now you will never see the crazy underwears I have on! 
Just as much from the out - of - doors. 
I've enough of this shit! I'm gonna get a lawyer. 
Nature's presence is felt in your room, inviting you to escape - which enchanted garden hides behind the boarding? 
But when you look at the woodcut, it looks like a rocket ship. 
I'm gonna be Frank. OK. Can I still be Garth? 
The main artery was cut and blood was spurting out 
I am telling you a good man would quit first. 
After I hit the jackpot, I kind of lost control, all right? 
I'm not listening to this anymore. Another second is too fucking long. 
Fuck off. You're not missing the game. You wanted to learn about soccer. 
I'm afraid I don't know what to say to that.

He had learned to read the signs and to negotiate fear, 
When we've been fighting about the car and the road trip,

You plan to live in the mall for the next four years? 
It's reasonable for you to think that money was yours and not hers. 
Chatting away with him as though he were any other neighbor. 
That's what I'm saying. If he'd written me, told me he'd be there... 
Relax in our non-smoking suite with a king bed, refrigerator and a sofabed for those extra guests. 
He was kind of like working with the Cape, walking on his knee. 
And chipping is coming with me too. What, old chipping going abroad?

He fired me. I got nothing to say about that guy. 
Fuck the national anthem... I have to get home... Come on! 
Why didn't he kill her instead of freeing her to warn the secret service? 
So? So, what if he learns she was in trouble? 
Because when I do that, it sends a flame, shooting through the engine 
But it took huge bravery to defy Pope and emperor. 
She said he's been hit two centimeters next to his heart. 
And I know that Mr. childs is trying to catch me in a perjury trap, 
But, uh, we still got an hour till movie starts. 
You want people to look at you differently? Make them. 
It's hard enough being in this damned thing for hours without listening to you guys.

Another casualty of the neighborhood, just like your dead half - brother.

Would you like me to tell them who you are? 
It's just we sort of kind of lost the girl. What girl? 
Set up a weapons package. I'll meet you in the motor pool. 
I can lift the valve from some fresh meat and then drop it in a new client 
I know you're angry about me and Kim, but l won't let you stop me from doing my job. 
But that doesn't make me your girl. - yeah. Doesn't make... 
Many people went there yesterday. I'll let you off before the stop. 
I can't go in there and see her like that.

All you ever tried to do was protect me and love me. 
I got 50 euros for making a hole in the ice.

You've gotta figure - if we're all gonna be replaced by machines, 
If you don't mind, I need you to park around the corner, okay? 
I carry a lot of influence with Desot. Don't you worry.

finding a blue whale at sea is like finding an extraordinarily large needle 
I've seen people do some serious stuff to hide an affair. 
And I was surrounded by all these confident, sexy women, 
Of course not, mom, because it's going to be a wild party 
Now if the authorities let them keep eating like that, 
Look, right now the evidence tells us that you killed the man

You don't think I can handle it. I don't think you should have to. 
And she hasn't gotten back to me - not even a text. 
And he's got some difficulties now that maybe he didn't have then. 
If I want to cross him off my list before they send him to state prison, 
He doesn't need us to kill or die for him. 
Well, yes, actually. I was waiting for an old friend. 
Hey, I had a really nice time with you last weekend.

So tonight, we have two of the officers here who patrol your neighborhood. 
Yeah, yeah, the 21st century. Everyone's life is more complicated.

If he were eliminated, his boss would be forced to make more public appearances. 
I don't know how long I sat there trying to figure a way out, 
The other candidates will have been and have done courses on what they've seen. 
I should just go over to the kitchen. Good to see you. Cute kid. 
Only new life defeats death. What is that supposed to mean? 
I think my face actually hurts from smiling so much.

Isn't that guy in rehab? If you consider a kidney replacement a rehab, yeah. 
This coming from a girl who was selling hot dogs three months ago? 
I'm going to pull the tape off, and you're going to cream,
