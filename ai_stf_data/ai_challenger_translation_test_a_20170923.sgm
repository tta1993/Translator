<seg id="1696"> Oh, my God. You guys, we could do this. We could do this. </seg>
<seg id="1697"> To hand out half - a - trillion dollars to foreigners? </seg>
<seg id="1698"> Fold the hand. Look, this is our thing that we're talking about. </seg>
<seg id="1699"> Or instead, maybe you could just not marry my brother, Frank? </seg>
<seg id="1700"> I Haven't counted on you for a long time - </seg>
<seg id="1701"> Okay, I guess you're not there. Listen, I got a free night tonight. </seg>
<seg id="1702"> Why did they do that? 'cause it howls all night long. </seg>
<seg id="1703"> I thought the case was all wrapped up. It was. It is. </seg>
<seg id="1704"> I can't stay in a pub and not have a drink. </seg>

<seg id="1712"> So, it's a good thing you're going to outlive him, lady. </seg>
<seg id="1713"> I think I might want this more than anyone else here. </seg>
<seg id="1714"> And I noticed that you had to kind of cover it or hold it to make sure... </seg>
<seg id="1715"> Does that mean I have to claim it on my taxes now? </seg>
<seg id="1716"> Oh, it's over by the Cuisinart next to the stove. </seg>
<seg id="1717"> I don't think so. I've never seen anything like it. </seg>
<seg id="1718"> I told him just to take what he wanted and to leave, </seg>

<seg id="1763"> Well, even if we could, these are our friends and neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="1764"> And she's going to need it if she's actually stupid enough to marry that guy. </seg>
<seg id="1765"> It bore the mark of one of the great houses, </seg>
<seg id="1766"> I mean, can we definitively rule out him being a plant? </seg>
<seg id="1767"> It's got nothing to do with being a mind reader. I told you about the yellow. </seg>

<seg id="1794"> I know how much it means to you to be a father. </seg>
<seg id="1795"> But I don't think the strong point is the singing. </seg>

<seg id="1814"> But I was always having to make myself less sparkly so that she wouldn't feel insecure. </seg>
<seg id="1815"> You said you can help me. You said I can trust you. </seg>
<seg id="1816"> You got a gun to his head, so you think I won't splatter you all over? </seg>

<seg id="1900"> And it's not unusual when you have a heated trial. </seg>
<seg id="1901"> Hey, uh, I thought you had already left for work, so... </seg>
<seg id="1902"> Yeah, thanks for coming. It's always a pleasure. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="1903"> The more you freak out, the more you're gonna spread that stuff around. </seg>

<seg id="7218"> Bring your thermos each morning and we will fill it with hot coffee. </seg>
<seg id="7219"> I'm going to be magnanimous and say it's our idea and our failure, </seg>
<seg id="7220"> I have eight doctors who requisitioned nerve stimulators in the last year. </seg>
<seg id="7221"> If I had a choice between him and you, I'd choose you. </seg>
<seg id="7222"> I don't think so. I am smarter and better protected than whitey thinks. </seg>
<seg id="7223"> Come, come, my good man. Let me have service, or I'll take my patronage elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="7224"> Don't look so shocked. She's there just in case, that's all. </seg>
<seg id="7225"> Not quite. In hibernation, a bear's heartbeat is just very slow. </seg>
<seg id="7226"> I didn't want him to bother, but my son insisted. </seg>
<seg id="7227"> And basically left to fend for themselves as things got really tough. </seg>
<seg id="7228"> That you'll be putting them in danger if you go back. </seg>
<seg id="7229"> Can I have milk too? Mm. But first we'll have a little talk. </seg>

<seg id="7236"> He's twisting the facts, that's what he's doing. Don't you see? </seg>
<seg id="7237"> All they'd give me was a fiver. How much are you short? </seg>
<seg id="7238"> There is no version of star trek I do not enjoy. </seg>
<seg id="7239"> I saw my face on the news, turned myself in. </seg>
<seg id="7240"> Come on! Look where you wanna go. You're doing great. </seg>
<seg id="7241"> Yeah. It looks really irritated. It's so red. What happened? </seg>
<seg id="7242"> It's first tryouts, and all my stuff's in about a hundred boxes. </seg>
<seg id="7243"> Because you my girl, you got to ride on my bike. </seg>
<seg id="7244"> I'm from the future or maybe you rescued me from the pit of a volcano. </seg>
<seg id="7245"> Yeah, it'd be tragic to be out here and not have the opportunity to film this. </seg>
<seg id="7246"> I just need to find something that won't cost an money to cross off my list. </seg>
<seg id="7247"> As you can see by the rest of your armada, you have no choice. </seg>
<seg id="7248"> Holy God. You gotta get me outta here. Just calm down. </seg>
<seg id="7249"> But unlike most of his classmates, Mondain knows to read and write. </seg>
<seg id="7250"> You know, some people, when they walk into a room - </seg>
<seg id="7251"> Okay, okay. Then I cut loose. A lot of moves. </seg>
<seg id="7252"> If there's one thing we aristocrats enjoy, it's a fabulous party. </seg>
<seg id="7253"> I'll wait and see how happy your insane marriage will be! </seg>
<seg id="7254"> We just have a detainee, who said he buried a guy, who looked like Abu Ahmed. </seg>
<seg id="7255"> That's exactly what I mean. Anyway, I've got to get some sleep. </seg>
<seg id="7256"> If you had to give a prognosis, what would it be? </seg>
<seg id="7257"> It's a bit formal. Want me to sign a contract? </seg>
<seg id="7258"> I'll put it on the mantelpiece, and there's an invitation from Lord Armstrong for </seg>
<seg id="7259"> Just a temporary fence with a padlock for insurance purposes. </seg>
<seg id="7260"> Brother Ping - Chung, how's your business in Hong Kong? </seg>

<seg id="7263"> And the trip wouldn't last more than a few moments. </seg>
<seg id="7264"> I was - I was just here -  The other day. </seg>
<seg id="7265"> Rent the girl a hand truck and get this crap out of here. </seg>
<seg id="7266"> That, um, you kind of had a nerve with me today, </seg>
<seg id="7267"> I was just thinking about what it would be like </seg>
<seg id="7268"> There's a reason the police keep jumping out on you. </seg>
<seg id="7269"> I inferred that Mr. Briggs had been sitting in this corner, </seg>
<seg id="7270"> I don't want them growing up illiterate like their pa. </seg>
<seg id="7271"> Yeah. Sounds like she got close with someone else too. </seg>
<seg id="7272"> So, by the 1890s, you have the consolidation of the germ theory of disease, </seg>
<seg id="7273"> Would you be happy being treated like an alien in your own country? </seg>
<seg id="7274"> Where did you find her, and how can I get one? </seg>
<seg id="7275"> It is a quiet neighborhood, difficult to find us easily. </seg>
<seg id="7276"> No, I can't stop, I'm afraid. My wife is being towed away. </seg>
<seg id="7277"> And do you love him? I don't see how that's relevant. </seg>
<seg id="7278"> Only a few know that their actual wedding took place </seg>
<seg id="7279"> Well, birthdays only come but once a year, for those of you using the Julian calendar. </seg>

<seg id="7282"> Well, if you give me the number, I know somebody who can track it. </seg>
<seg id="7283"> That's a bold comparison. - I think we've earned it. </seg>
<seg id="7284"> Why can't you reach her? When I heard what she did </seg>
<seg id="7285"> The women there selling lottery tickets would call out, "para hoy, </seg>
<seg id="7286"> I will take care of it on the way to the airport. </seg>
<seg id="7287"> But in the meantime, I'd like to ask you a few questions, if you don't mind. </seg>
<seg id="7288"> And when I do, everyone is gonna run for his tent. </seg>
<seg id="7289"> Hey, look, I - I didn't do this. I - I swear, I... I... </seg>
<seg id="7290"> Yeah, well, I thought - well, I'd hoped that you 'd, uh, you'd stick around now. </seg>
<seg id="7291"> And you're okay with having to give up your whole Manhattan fantasy? </seg>
<seg id="7292"> If you'd like, I can talk to them about getting you a job. </seg>
<seg id="7293"> I mean, you ever think about giving it another shot? </seg>
<seg id="7294"> There is no such thing as a wild firing style. </seg>
<seg id="7295"> But will you be happy knowing you could have made her a lot happier. </seg>

<seg id="7373"> All night we've been asking our dancers to tell us </seg>

<seg id="7405"> It looks like we have fallen under another vigilante assault, </seg>
<seg id="7406"> You remember me, though, yeah? You know who I am? </seg>
<seg id="7407"> I thought I'd send for them now. Tonight I was going to take a look at them. </seg>
<seg id="7408"> This is why you've been pushing me so hard, huh? </seg>
<seg id="7409"> And I like to call this the sort of inter - changeability of form - </seg>

<seg id="7419"> I myself am -      hey - </seg>
<seg id="7420"> That's harsh. You don't bounce back from that right away. </seg>
<seg id="7421"> Well, it's one of those cases, you know? It just hits a nerve. </seg>
<seg id="7422"> I'm in love with my cousin. She's got beautiful long hair. </seg>
<seg id="7423"> There is one chance of survival - defeating England in tomorrow's match. </seg>
<seg id="7424"> She says, ''the custard is in the oven at 350." Over. </seg>
<seg id="7425"> At least as speech in a language she's familiar with. </seg>
<seg id="7426"> Instead of paying for the cruise, I signed us up as dance hosts. </seg>
<seg id="7427"> It's sort of like a frat house for cartel soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="7428"> His name is on the ball of fame with all the greats that came off these courts. </seg>
<seg id="7429"> No. I can prove it if you'll show me your chest. </seg>
<seg id="7430"> What do you think, we're gonna wing it? Take a gander. </seg>
<seg id="7431"> By doing the same things you and the other guys are doing. </seg>
<seg id="7432"> If you want to tune something, tune yourself. Go talk to him. </seg>
<seg id="7433"> I had no choice, Merlin. Uther had to be told. </seg>
<seg id="7434"> That I have no parental rights because I'm a drug dealer. </seg>
<seg id="7435"> You'd think you'd find the time to go to the market. - 21, 22... </seg>
<seg id="7436"> Can I just ask you to please - to be careful with my husband? </seg>
<seg id="7437"> My son is dying. She's the only one who can save him. </seg>
<seg id="7438"> She wondered what he would discover in the swath of brunette truth she had given up. </seg>
<seg id="7439"> So, I've been working through the paperwork to get him into the program. </seg>
<seg id="7440"> I have a theory, but it's not flushed out. Never mind. </seg>
<seg id="7441"> Hey, it turns out my girlfriend has to work tonight. </seg>
<seg id="7442"> I'm on the phone with a colleague. I won't be long. </seg>
<seg id="7443"> We have only a prisoner who said he had buried someone who looked like Abu Ahmed. </seg>
<seg id="7444"> Were you able to get anything out of the little brother? </seg>
<seg id="7445"> Who's been making ridiculously large cash deposits to his checking account on a weekly basis. </seg>
<seg id="7446"> Yeah - they - probably - will sort of thing going on. </seg>
<seg id="7447"> You're just lying there, like you want me to rape you! </seg>
<seg id="7448"> I'm afraid he was killed in the line of duty. </seg>
<seg id="7449"> Yeah, well, I might have felt more sorry for you </seg>
<seg id="7450"> Hey, man, did you... Did I what... Sleep with her? </seg>
<seg id="7451"> A lot of people. You threw us all for a loop there, pal. </seg>
<seg id="7452"> I needed to get a baseline on this guy, see how he acts when he's not threatened. </seg>
<seg id="7453"> We'll be lucky to fill the damn hall for one debate, </seg>
<seg id="7454"> And gave him thirty years, to serve a minimum of twenty - five. </seg>
<seg id="7455"> So the first opportunity you had, you set her up... </seg>
<seg id="7456"> You want one of my fags, is that what it is? </seg>
<seg id="7457"> Where on earth did you learn that, Max? Come on, let me help you. </seg>
<seg id="7458"> First it was supposed to be the civil trials department in Seoul, </seg>
<seg id="7459"> Miserable today, tomorrow, pretty much every day, until the day you sell. </seg>
<seg id="7460"> A moral fusion between law and order and clinical care. </seg>

<seg id="7462"> Cable satellite television, 32-inch LCD television with two HBO? channels, STARZ, ESPN, CNN? - all basic channels. </seg>
<seg id="7463"> At the beginning of the school year he had buried ajar of pennies... </seg>
<seg id="7464"> Well, all the environment circuits are fed through this one here. </seg>
<seg id="7465"> All I need is your special skills to get me somewhere. </seg>
<seg id="7466"> Golly gee, thanks for making me feel like I'm eight. </seg>
<seg id="7467"> What do you think he'd do if we went after dude? </seg>
<seg id="7468"> Looks like the kind of pair who would kill the archbishop. </seg>
<seg id="7469"> I know. I wanted a quiet evening, too. But somehow - </seg>
<seg id="7470"> It's those two bastards again. Look at those two, so mean. </seg>
<seg id="7471"> And you can see its hairpin shape right down here. </seg>
<seg id="7472"> Even if you thought you spent an incredible, meaningful night with somebody, </seg>
<seg id="7473"> I took action to ensure my right to be provided a quality education, </seg>
<seg id="7474"> The president wants to keep that information restricted for the time being. </seg>
<seg id="7475"> Like his backpack which has his personal stuff in it. </seg>
<seg id="7476"> Sir, we can't have you tying your child up outside the store. It looks very bad. </seg>
<seg id="7477"> Because if this had been a foxtrot, which is one of your strong dances the ballroom, </seg>
<seg id="7478"> Real quick, do an image search for "quantum physicist genius". </seg>
<seg id="7479"> I have known some women who are said to be witches. </seg>
<seg id="7480"> Failed ambitions and the overwhelming desire to have a bath with a toaster. </seg>
<seg id="7481"> I was just about to call you. I couldn't wait. </seg>
<seg id="7482"> But... Huh, you haven't approached the possibility of divorce yet? </seg>
<seg id="7483"> I can't tell you what that first song was about. </seg>
<seg id="7484"> And then suddenIy, I realized that he was actually right. </seg>
<seg id="7485"> If the missile hadn't diverted, the Kremlin would be in chaos. </seg>
<seg id="7486"> You're really that mad? I mean, he's a ghost. They lie to us all the time. </seg>
<seg id="7487"> So, how are you and Tom '? Any kids yet'? </seg>
<seg id="7488"> Do you remember what I was doing when we first met? </seg>
<seg id="7489"> And I could arrest a high official of our enemies </seg>
<seg id="7490"> You live your life, you try to be a good person, </seg>
<seg id="7491"> It's a woman's voice because I got loads of liquid peroxide. </seg>
<seg id="7492"> Today I have strung up cranberries. We have baked gingerbread... </seg>

<seg id="7773"> So, what's so important that you didn't want to talk about it on the phone? </seg>
<seg id="7774"> Baby ch... Baby Charlie. He barely survived beyond infancy and... </seg>
<seg id="7775"> I...I'm in town that it'll be over in just two shakes, OK? </seg>
<seg id="7776"> Oh, my God. We have our work cut out for us. </seg>
<seg id="7777"> Great. Now the other guys have spike. We got nothing. </seg>
<seg id="7778"> How is he? - guess what. He's a bad patient. </seg>
<seg id="7779"> When I return to London on Monday next. It is decided. </seg>
<seg id="7780"> You've been so patient with me. It shows how much you really care. </seg>
<seg id="7781"> Well, it's pretty goddamn clear what we need to do. </seg>
<seg id="7782"> The bathroom is equipped with a bathtub and a hairdryer. </seg>
<seg id="7783"> Uh, yeah, the whole thing seems a little twisted to me, too. </seg>
<seg id="7784"> You help us find these guys, and we will split our fee for the case. </seg>
<seg id="7785"> I got it from your sisters. I do not need it from you. </seg>
<seg id="7786"> And if there are any historians about 50or 100yearsfrom now... </seg>
<seg id="7787"> Her life has revolved around you every single day of the past 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="7788"> My advice is for you to marry this charming young lady. </seg>
<seg id="7789"> But she was different around him. I mean, it was impossible not to be... </seg>
<seg id="7790"> Today, I'm gonna show you how to wear a kilt! </seg>
<seg id="7791"> Well, I think they remodeled our forest. I like it. Stylish, yet functional. </seg>
<seg id="7792"> I've been on a diet every day since I was 19, </seg>
<seg id="7793"> So I thought that I would take her to the lake where we used to play. </seg>
<seg id="7794"> What are you doing? We must finish what we started. </seg>
<seg id="7795"> So tonight, we have two of the officers here who patrol your neighborhood. </seg>
<seg id="7796"> Yeah, yeah, the 21st century. Everyone's life is more complicated. </seg>
<seg id="7797"> Let go of my hand and also my shirt. Sure, I will. </seg>
<seg id="7798"> Yeah, I'm sure if we went to the burn unit, </seg>
<seg id="7799"> What did you do? Oh, all right, I called him. </seg>
<seg id="7800"> But they've never interfered with my ability to do anything. </seg>
<seg id="7801"> l cross - referenced the files Ellis sent us with our Interpol records. </seg>
<seg id="7802"> And I need of taking responsibility for all the mistakes I've made??? </seg>
<seg id="7803"> I think he's a lawyer. Why is he in my office? </seg>
<seg id="7804"> Perhaps a mutation from yaws, from a disease already present in Europe - </seg>
<seg id="7805"> Last night, I told her to haul her ass out of town before she's deported. </seg>
<seg id="7806"> Why you paged every resident to the skills lab but me. </seg>
<seg id="7807"> For out of it was thou taken, for dust thou art, </seg>
<seg id="7808"> I see you're back to playing for the other team. </seg>
<seg id="7809"> I can do that for him. No, no. It's fine. </seg>
<seg id="7810"> What if she's a hag? Or she simply won't have me? </seg>
<seg id="7811"> Me does not talk concerning powers, this a terrorist action is, </seg>
<seg id="7812"> You set up a slush fund of cash to work with, </seg>
<seg id="7813"> And the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold makes no never mind to you? </seg>
<seg id="7814"> County reinforced it, and now they're clearing it out for condos or whatever. </seg>
<seg id="7815"> Can you look at me when I speak with you? </seg>
<seg id="7816"> You know, I really think so. Something... Something about this. </seg>
<seg id="7817"> So I called my dad to see if he could help out with the whole - </seg>
<seg id="7818"> That's the reason you're seeing a lot of these murders taking place. </seg>
<seg id="7819"> Coach broke down in tears and said he didn't think the game deserved his nobility, </seg>
<seg id="7820"> One cannot turn tail and run like a common criminal, can one? </seg>
<seg id="7821"> All of a sudden it just started raining. </seg>
<seg id="7822"> The way I am now, I wouldn't trust me either. </seg>
<seg id="7823"> You didn't tell him I'm a top - class girl? </seg>
<seg id="7824"> I'm tired of play and ask permission to resume my work. </seg>
<seg id="7825"> Sure, till the summer I found out he sold hot dogs at the ballpark. </seg>
<seg id="7826"> If it takes longer than three hours, I'll pay you. </seg>
<seg id="7827"> Can you keep your trap shut if we tell why we need it? </seg>
<seg id="7828"> If you want a slightly tougher book, more rigorous book, </seg>
<seg id="7829"> You have lost your element of surprise a little bit, I think. </seg>
<seg id="7830"> Where they been, it's a miracle more guys don't blow off for a few days. </seg>
<seg id="7831"> In my field, I see these people that - Oh, sorry. </seg>
<seg id="7832"> The central nervous systems survived the onslaught from the virus. </seg>
<seg id="7833"> I'm going to go put my shirt in the washer. </seg>
<seg id="7834"> You invited mehere to this dinner most likely to tell me that </seg>
<seg id="7835"> But since she kept me up all night, I looked into the clinic's finances. </seg>
<seg id="7836"> I'm afraid we've hit a snag on the deviled eggs. </seg>
<seg id="7837"> He's so smart, your brother. He's a really bright boy. </seg>
<seg id="7838"> So I went back to the parents, and, yes, uh, kid's adopted. </seg>
<seg id="7839"> I'll do what I can, but he's heading back up to the room. </seg>
<seg id="7840"> It's rented, so it has to go back in one piece when we're done. </seg>
<seg id="7841"> I know we have a lot to catch up on, </seg>
<seg id="7842"> I just shouldn't have said what I did, and I'm sorry. </seg>
<seg id="7843"> We have got to get some. Is that my latte? </seg>
<seg id="7844"> Cary, I know you were supposed to have tomorrow off, </seg>
<seg id="7845"> Although, the people at Cartier took a pretty good shot at it. </seg>
<seg id="7846"> That is great! You know who would love that is John. </seg>
<seg id="7847"> We can cry about it or keep looking. I'm not crying. </seg>
<seg id="7848"> That was the only satellite dish in town getting a signal, our only link to the outside world. </seg>
<seg id="7849"> So he just dropped off ten tonnes of dead robot </seg>
<seg id="7850"> You don't have the strength or ability of a thoroughbred... </seg>
<seg id="7851"> But even if he wasn't, once the attack happens, he will be. </seg>
<seg id="7852"> I could, but why should they know what I know? </seg>
<seg id="7853"> It's guys like you, they think they know how to do everything better, </seg>
<seg id="7854"> Well, I am afraid that is rather a long story. </seg>
<seg id="7855"> But you don't need to be a chem major to know that. </seg>
<seg id="7856"> The rest of the prints are ready. Goody. Hang in there. </seg>
<seg id="7857"> Get up every day and work for a living! Let's see him try that! </seg>
<seg id="7858"> The shortest orbital period of a planet in our own solar system </seg>
<seg id="7859"> He had a shadow of a beard, a dark beard, </seg>
<seg id="7860"> But if we can't win this year the school might end the ensemble. </seg>
<seg id="7861"> So when do you get the kids again? Monday after school. </seg>
<seg id="7862"> So, you know, anyways, I'm saving up for a new car. </seg>
<seg id="7863"> I hear that the British love Americans coming over here and scaring their </seg>
<seg id="7864"> From: Newcastle Airport, A1 Southbound and leave at Junction 56. </seg>
<seg id="7865"> Every time I mention his name, you take a shot at me. </seg>
<seg id="7866"> Y 'know, I mean we're gonna see each other all the time. </seg>
<seg id="7867"> Oh, look at this. That looks kind of overpriced and fishy. </seg>
<seg id="7868"> There were red geraniums and the clocks were ticking away. </seg>
<seg id="7869"> Well, I think one fresh - faced kid on the team is enough. </seg>
<seg id="7870"> And you did everything you could. Yeah, I know. I always do, don't I? </seg>
<seg id="7871"> Do you solemnly swear the testimony you're about to give is entirely truthful? </seg>
<seg id="7872"> Yes, unless you want to smell like a skunk all week. </seg>
<seg id="7873"> But he won't let me fearing l have a wound </seg>
<seg id="7874"> So, you went round your garden and you eradicated all these plants. </seg>
<seg id="7875"> I'm not interested in getting old if all I get to drink is green tea. </seg>
<seg id="7876"> When we turned in the first 40 pages, we were pumped. </seg>
<seg id="7877"> Of course, this is the right thing for the firm. </seg>
<seg id="7878"> For all the hatred that you have for this country, you don't understand it very well. </seg>
<seg id="7879"> Where do we start with a man who is bigger than John was </seg>
<seg id="7880"> No, that would be quite impossible. She died from a congenital heart weakness. </seg>
<seg id="7881"> You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. </seg>
<seg id="7882"> He didn't stuff himself. He's not the cause of this. </seg>
<seg id="7883"> We don't like to keep patients your age under anesthesia for that long. </seg>
<seg id="7884"> I'm about to get in a screaming match with my boss, </seg>
<seg id="7885"> So after you've enacted the plan that you're proposing here tonight, </seg>
<seg id="7886"> And I am certain that you're very good at it - </seg>
<seg id="7887"> You bring a roller case full of fuck knows - what and forget the most important piece - </seg>
<seg id="7888"> Hey! Wait till you see what we're having for dinner tonight! </seg>
<seg id="7889"> What do you think would happen if you didn't tell the stories? </seg>
<seg id="7890"> Okay, soyou can have the graveyard shift 6:00 to midnight. </seg>
<seg id="7891"> If that was my wife, I know where I'd be. </seg>
<seg id="7892"> If you are not allowed to see your loved ones, it's sad, </seg>
<seg id="7893"> No, I'm warning you. - we need to talk about this. </seg>
<seg id="7894"> I'm wondering why you expect your fellow Canadians, who don't have your problem, </seg>
<seg id="7895"> You calling me a punk? I'm trying to get justice. </seg>
<seg id="7896"> it all comes down to right now, it's up to us </seg>
<seg id="7897"> No, you merely gave her the combination to the safe that contained the money </seg>
<seg id="7898"> But his droopy wing doesn't seem to be getting any better, </seg>
<seg id="7899"> Even if the object of your affection is begging you to. </seg>
<seg id="7900"> If he were eliminated, his boss would be forced to make more public appearances. </seg>
<seg id="7901"> I don't know how long I sat there trying to figure a way out, </seg>
<seg id="7902"> The other candidates will have been and have done courses on what they've seen. </seg>
<seg id="7903"> I should just go over to the kitchen. Good to see you. Cute kid. </seg>
<seg id="7904"> Only new life defeats death. What is that supposed to mean? </seg>
<seg id="7905"> I think my face actually hurts from smiling so much. </seg>
<seg id="7906"> It should appear as a cloudy patch with a star cluster glimmering in front of it. </seg>
<seg id="7907"> Don't panic. I'm not here to work. I'm here to eat. </seg>
<seg id="7908"> I hate that it has to be that way, but... </seg>
<seg id="7909"> While Stephen worked off his drunk by slapping you around! </seg>
<seg id="7910"> It wouldn't have happened if you'd done what I told you to. </seg>
<seg id="7911"> What Lun needs now most of all is your care </seg>
<seg id="7912"> And all is forgiven - even the pop in the mouth. </seg>
<seg id="7913"> And I think if we can round up the guys who were in that band... </seg>
<seg id="7914"> You are 30 hours and 59 minutes - turn her off. </seg>
<seg id="7915"> Have this letter dispatched to the Marquis de Montesquieu immediately. </seg>
<seg id="7916"> Oh, look at that, the Knicks lost another game, but the writer doesn't trash the whole team. </seg>
<seg id="7917"> Well, I never said I still don't have a long - distance girlfriend but... </seg>
<seg id="7918"> I shouldn't have come down on you so hard about the smoking. </seg>
<seg id="7919"> And aside from the fact that my vag - a - matic </seg>
<seg id="7920"> I'm so sorry, sir. I tried to stop him - not your fault, sweetheart. </seg>
<seg id="7921"> Yeah, and you know he was cheating when he played Bao. </seg>
<seg id="7922"> You gotta wait three weeks for them to be weaned </seg>
<seg id="7923"> Many of our staff members have been with us for a long time, and they know the region well. </seg>
<seg id="7924"> If you think that I'm qualified to conduct scientific research </seg>
<seg id="7925"> Go back to Wayne enterprises now and start making more of that antidote. </seg>
<seg id="7926"> He called each of them on the cell phone he wasn't supposed to have. </seg>
<seg id="7927"> Because you are - you are miss personality, you know? </seg>
<seg id="7928"> I know you're nervous about us being far apart next year, so I got something. </seg>
<seg id="7929"> He came down into the basement and crawled into my sleeping bag. </seg>
<seg id="7930"> You think getting butt nak on your fit day of work </seg>
<seg id="7931"> The Urgals' presence here can only mean that the king's men are not far behind. </seg>
<seg id="7932"> You know, if it's not pink calling you, then you got good Charlotte - </seg>
<seg id="7933"> Make it quick. This cell is running out of juice. </seg>
<seg id="7934"> I always feel a little nervous going into these places. Why's that? </seg>
<seg id="7935"> Because you got no discipline. You'll be trying to start fights every time I turn my back. </seg>
<seg id="7936"> And so they resumed grooming one another and showing no interest in this young female. </seg>
<seg id="7937"> But it can only work if you trust me completely. </seg>
<seg id="7938"> Don't kill him. I want to know what vonkel told them. </seg>
<seg id="7939"> Three years later and I still haven't seen your manga. </seg>
<seg id="7940"> You just need to blow off some steam, and get some perspective. </seg>
<seg id="7941"> Gee, I sure hope the rain doesn't ruin this dress. </seg>
<seg id="7942"> You want the world to think that David is dead? </seg>
<seg id="7943"> From their pimps grieved bitterly. I don't Iike this dog. </seg>
<seg id="7944"> What would you do? If it was your kid, what would you do? </seg>
<seg id="7945"> I know a guy - know what I'm saying someone who can deal with this. </seg>
<seg id="7946"> But, um, we're going to have to back out now. </seg>
<seg id="7947"> And he / she has his / her baseball glove and baby. </seg>
<seg id="7948"> I think the person that grew my last pot sent "eat mini-donuts while playing with your balls" vibrations. </seg>
<seg id="7949"> You look just as pretty as you were on our wedding day </seg>
<seg id="7950"> He must have bought up everything the guy ever touched. </seg>
<seg id="7951"> Why's a tough girl like you dressing up as a French maid? </seg>
<seg id="7952"> Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders. </seg>
<seg id="7953"> I - look, I make a buck ,25 a week dressed like the freaking Nutcracker. </seg>
<seg id="7954"> So we might have a shot at coming out ahead on this, </seg>
<seg id="7955"> If you were my lawyer, and I was your client, what would you tell me to do? </seg>
<seg id="7956"> The son of judge beaubien has never been killed before. </seg>
<seg id="7957"> I cannot for that damned opera, I must to come here and the bad guy? </seg>
<seg id="7958"> Do you want me to wait till you quit the building? </seg>
<seg id="7959"> There's only one thing I know of that could create this kind of gravitational pull. </seg>
<seg id="7960"> So I'm supposed to drop everything and join the struggle, </seg>
<seg id="7961"> Isn't that guy in rehab? If you consider a kidney replacement a rehab, yeah. </seg>
<seg id="7962"> This coming from a girl who was selling hot dogs three months ago? </seg>
<seg id="7963"> I'm going to pull the tape off, and you're going to cream, </seg>
<seg id="7964"> Hey, watch it. I can't afford to be injured. I've got a major event to plan. </seg>
<seg id="7965"> I thought it was really important that we had a goal number </seg>
<seg id="7966"> I'll keep looking, but so far this place is spotless </seg>
<seg id="7967"> I mean, what will people say at my funeral? Seriously, would I have a good eulogy? </seg>
<seg id="7968"> Hey, Turk, I gotta skip tonight. My class run late. </seg>
<seg id="7969"> Where am I going to get $350,000, unless I sell my - </seg>
<seg id="7970"> If you know so much about these murders, why do you need me? </seg>
<seg id="7971"> I got a couple choices, but once I start shooting, </seg>
<seg id="7972"> Raise your hand, stay, raise if you want to go. </seg>
<seg id="7973"> Hey pal, just drop it down here. We're pushing it alright. </seg>
<seg id="7974"> It's gonna be about an hour before we get on stage. </seg>
<seg id="7975"> Winston and Shelby, you guys have obviously found love, so... </seg>
<seg id="7976"> My wife Rosie and I would like to welcome you this afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="7977"> He's stopped me on the street. Will you shut up? </seg>
<seg id="7978"> It's not like I could go skiing or - or mountain climbing or... </seg>
<seg id="7979"> You know what? Now you can't even get a date... </seg>
<seg id="7980"> The only thing more boring than listening to an artist describe his process </seg>
<seg id="7981"> Oh my God, the back of your hair still looks wonderful. </seg>
<seg id="7982"> So if we ask them to perform on 23, they'll say it's outside my contract </seg>
<seg id="7983"> Yes. Oh, your father bought an exercise device off television. </seg>
<seg id="7984"> He would like you to come back home for the time being. How do you lose a tail? </seg>
<seg id="7985"> I'm a crew guy, so maybe I'll put in a good word for you. </seg>
<seg id="7986"> Sorry. You know what they say about dipping the pen in the company ink. </seg>
<seg id="7987"> Yeah, but, honey, Midland is our home. I mean, the kids' lives are here. </seg>
<seg id="7988"> Then can I offer you membership in our book club? 10% off today. 5% in the future. </seg>
<seg id="7989"> Except the same thing happened in 1958 three different times </seg>
<seg id="7990"> I don't have a choice. No, Robert, this is a big risk. </seg>
<seg id="7991"> So I'm not gonna talk about this in front of you. </seg>
<seg id="7992"> Contact numbers of people that can help them and cash for food and travel. </seg>
<seg id="7993"> Already in them. A little early for that. Come on. Have a seat. </seg>
<seg id="7994"> Turning on the nitric oxide in response to lactic acid. </seg>
<seg id="7995"> I know, I wish I could prove it, but I can't. </seg>
<seg id="7996"> I don't know! He was acting funny and then he started coughing up blood. </seg>
<seg id="7997"> Several members of the staff can confirm that I was there </seg>
<seg id="7998"> I'm so glad you're here to keep me company, my dear. </seg>
<seg id="7999"> Sir, this is a police action. I need to talk </seg>
